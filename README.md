Browser Security Risks and Extension Management
===============================================

1. How can browser extensions pose security risks?
--------------------------------------------------
- Access sensitive data like passwords, cookies, and browsing history.
- Inject malicious scripts into web pages.
- Track online activity or harvest data for sale.
- Receive silent malicious updates post-installation.
- Appear legitimate while functioning as spyware.

2. What permissions should raise suspicion?
-------------------------------------------
- "Read and change all your data on websites you visit"
- Clipboard access
- Access to file system
- Background access or unlimited storage
- Access to tabs and browsing activity
(If the permission doesn’t match the extension’s purpose, be suspicious.)

3. How to safely install browser extensions?
--------------------------------------------
- Use official stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons).
- Check developer info, number of installs, and reviews.
- Avoid extensions with vague or no descriptions.
- Check update frequency – recent updates show active maintenance.

4. What is extension sandboxing?
--------------------------------
- Security mechanism isolating extensions from system/browser.
- Restricts access to sensitive data and resources.
- Helps prevent malicious behavior from affecting other tabs/extensions.
- Not all browsers enforce this strictly.

5. Can extensions steal passwords?
----------------------------------
Yes. They can:
- Log keystrokes
- Intercept login forms
- Access cookies and tokens
- Capture data from password managers

6. How to update extensions securely?
-------------------------------------
- Enable auto-updates in browser settings.
- Monitor permission changes after updates.
- Read update notes or changelogs.
- Remove suspicious extensions post-update.

7. Difference between extensions and plugins?
---------------------------------------------
